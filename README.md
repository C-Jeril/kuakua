## History of Positive Psychology

Positive psychology, an emerging field, is devoted to enhancing mental health and happiness. Its aim is to help individuals uncover and harness their strengths, thereby achieving higher levels of life satisfaction and joy.

The development of positive psychology began in the late 20th century and was formally introduced in 1997. This field gained recognition through the publication of 'Positive Psychology: An Introduction' by Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in January 2000.

Promoted by psychologist Martin Seligman and his colleagues, positive psychology represents a revolutionary shift in the field of psychology and marks a new milestone in the history of human society. It bridges the wisdom of Eastern and Western cultures and psychological research.

Seligman and his colleagues argue that psychology should go beyond studying mental illnesses and problems to explore ways to enhance mental health and happiness. Positive psychology employs scientific methods to study happiness and promotes a positive orientation within the field, focusing on cultivating positive psychological traits, well-being, and harmonious development.

Central to positive psychology is the concept of eudaimonia, a term from Aristotelian philosophy signifying the highest human good, often translated as 'flourishing' or 'the good life.' Positive psychologists often use the terms subjective well-being (SWB) and happiness interchangeably.

The field prioritizes enhancing both individual and societal well-being, studying 'positive subjective experiences, positive individual traits, and positive institutions... aimed at improving quality of life.'

They believe various factors contribute to happiness and subjective well-being, such as social connections with spouses, family, friends, colleagues, and broader networks; membership in clubs or social organizations; physical exercise and meditation practices.

Spirituality is also regarded as a factor that can enhance well-being. Researchers continue to study spiritual practices and religious devotion as potential sources of well-being and integral parts of positive psychology.

While financial income can increase happiness to a certain extent, beyond a specific threshold, its effect may level off or even decline. Positive psychology emphasizes cultivating an individual's positive qualities, the capacity for growth, and the freedom to shape one's destiny.

## What does positive psychology do for me?

Enhancing Well-Being and Optimal Functioning Positive psychology focuses on enhancing individuals' well-being and optimal functioning rather than merely alleviating symptoms, complementing rather than replacing traditional psychology. Common themes in positive psychology include savoring life, gratitude, kindness, promoting positive relationships, and pursuing hope and meaning.

Focus on Well-Being Research shows that well-being and psychopathology are moderately correlated yet independent constructs of mental health. Even after successful treatment of psychopathology, low levels of well-being may persist, forming a substantial risk factor for psychological distress.

Mitigating Psychological Symptoms High levels of well-being can buffer against psychological symptoms, including the relapse or recurrence of symptoms, and enhance the quality of life and longevity. Therefore, clinical samples can greatly benefit from positive psychological interventions (PPIs) that explicitly aim to enhance well-being, such as positive feelings, cognitions, or behaviors.

Auxiliary Role While positive psychology does not have a significant effect on relieving stress related to happiness, depression, or anxiety, its ability to indirectly alleviate psychological distress by enhancing well-being is widely recognized.

Key Benefits of Positive Psychology Savoring Life: Enjoying and appreciating positive experiences. Gratitude: Recognizing and being thankful for the good things in life. Kindness: Practicing compassion and altruism towards others. Promoting Positive Relationships: Building and maintaining healthy and supportive relationships. Pursuing Hope and Meaning: Striving for goals and finding purpose in life. By focusing on these aspects, positive psychology helps individuals lead more fulfilling and resilient lives.
